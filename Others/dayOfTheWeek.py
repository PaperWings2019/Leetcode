#     * TASK:   given year, month, day, find which day in the week, i.e. Saturday. Year will be between

#     * 
#     * METHOD: calculate the contribution of year, month and day, and add offset ï¼ˆexistence of leap year), finally
#               divide the contribution by 7 to get the result.
#     * 
#     * NOTE:   1. the week array in solution is rearranged such that the first day is in accordance with the first day
#                  in 1971
#               2. how to judge if it is a leap year? year % 400 == 0 or (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0)
#     * 
#     * TIME/
#     * SPACE:  O(N) / O(1)
